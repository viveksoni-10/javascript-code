## Overview
This project is a web application designed for the Weekly Test - 5 assignment. It implements various functionalities using JavaScript and provides a visually appealing and user-friendly interface for users to interact with.

## Functionalities Implemented

### 1. Dark Mode
Users can toggle between light and dark modes using a switch. The selected mode is saved in `localStorage` to persist across sessions.

### 2. Sign Up / Login Functionality
Basic sign-up and login functionalities are implemented. Users can sign up with their name, email, and password. The user data is saved in `localStorage`. Users can log in using their registered email and password.
