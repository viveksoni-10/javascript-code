## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **HTML**: Structuring the component layout.
- **CSS**: Styling shapes and creating transitions for a smooth, clean UI.
- **JavaScript**: Adding interactivity for shape and color changes using `Math.random()` and `Math.floor()`.

## 📋 Project Objectives

This project was built with the following goals in mind:

1. **Consistent User Interface**:
   - Create a clean, user-friendly design.
   - Ensure alignment and consistency across all elements.

2. **Visual Variety**:
   - Implement 10 colors and 5 distinct shapes for a visually rich experience.

3. **Randomized Interactivity**:
   - Use JavaScript to randomly select shapes and colors, making each interaction unique.

4. **Creativity & User Engagement**:
   - Add animations and other creative touches to elevate the user experience.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Random Color Generation**: When the "Change Color" button is clicked, a JavaScript function generates a random RGB color and applies it to the component. The color is picked from a range of vibrant options using `Math.random()` and `Math.floor()`.

2. **Random Shape Generation**: When the "Change Shape" button is clicked, another JavaScript function selects a random shape from the predefined set of shapes and updates the component’s style accordingly.
